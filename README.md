# Malaria Diagnosis

## Description
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files for diagnosing malaria using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained to classify cell images as infected or uninfected, leveraging CNN architectures for feature extraction and classification.


## Usage
1. Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to perform data analysis and model training.
2. Utilize the trained models stored in the `models/` directory for malaria diagnosis.
